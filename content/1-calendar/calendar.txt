## Social calendar

Our aim is to provide events and activities for all members of our collective. We also advertise other Finland related events in the area, whether or not they are organised by us. You are most welcome to everything we organise, from picnics in the park (including a game of pesäpallo) to pub nights (for over 18's). If you would like to have a point of contact to feel more comfortable coming for the first time, give our social secretary a shout and they will make sure there is someone to take you under their wing. But we are all very welcoming and friendly, so just say " Finns are such great people" and you are sure to find friends. See below our social calendar and tag along!

### 25th November 2017 18:00 - 00:00 - (link: /finland-100 text: Finland 100 Party)


### 9th December 2017 12:00 - Joulubasaari

The Finnish Saturday School in Bristol is holding its annual Christmas Bazaar/Joulubasaari at Oasis Brightstowe Academy.

There will be Finnish foods, glögi & gifts for sale, Xmas carol singing, a raffle & a special visit from Joulupukki for the kids.

This is our last fundraiser of the year so it would be great if you could bring some Finnish baked goods & if possible a raffle prize too. Hopefully we'll see you there!

### 28th April 2018 11:30 - Annual General Meeting

Open to all, including public. Please advise of any required agenda items.

### 12th May 2018 12:30 - Finnish Baseball, Blaise Castle

After the lesson, weather permitting, we will head for Blaise Castle just after noon for a picnic and Pesäpallo.

So, don't forget to bring your own food and drink and something to sit on. If you're not inclined to play Pesäpallo, just come along for the picnic and enjoy the Blaise Castle amenities and surroundings.

Hope to see you there.

## School calendar

As well as socials, Finland in Bristol organises Finnish lessons for adults and children of all levels. The school runs every second Saturday for two hours from 10am to 12pm. We have two groups for children (tiny ones and school age) and two groups for adults.
