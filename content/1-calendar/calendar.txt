## Social calendar


### 9th December 2017 12:00 - Joulubasaari

The Finnish Saturday School in Bristol is holding its annual Christmas Bazaar/Joulubasaari at Oasis Brightstowe Academy.

There will be Finnish foods, glögi & gifts for sale, Xmas carol singing, a raffle & a special visit from Joulupukki for the kids.

This is our last fundraiser of the year so it would be great if you could bring some Finnish baked goods & if possible a raffle prize too. Hopefully we'll see you there!

### 28th April 2018 11:30 - Annual General Meeting

Open to all, including public. Please advise of any required agenda items.

### 12th May 2018 12:30 - Finnish Baseball, Blaise Castle

After the lesson, weather permitting, we will head for Blaise Castle just after noon for a picnic and Pesäpallo.

So, don't forget to bring your own food and drink and something to sit on. If you're not inclined to play Pesäpallo, just come along for the picnic and enjoy the Blaise Castle amenities and surroundings.

Hope to see you there.
