About:

I have been the chairman for the Saturday School for the past three years and a student for the past four. I first experienced Finnish culture in the 90's whilst studying for a PhD; part of my research being undertaken in the Department of Radiochemistry of the University of Helsinki. I maintain close links with Finland and his Finnish friends, visiting the country at least once a year.  I am the main point of contact for all general enquiries.
