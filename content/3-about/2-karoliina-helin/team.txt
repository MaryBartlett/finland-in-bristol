About:

Hi! I am one of the teachers here in FiB, I teach the beginners group for adults every second Saturday. I also am the Vice President of FiB as well as the Social Secretary. So yes, you will most definitely see me around to the point of boredom. I love coordinating things (and people for everyone else's annoyance) so I will most likely know everything that is going on/will be going on within the collective. If there is anything you would like to know or want to have a familiar face to look for in events, let me know!

I came to Bristol in September 2013 to get my university degree in interior architecture, after that I was lucky enough to get a job straight away in lighting design, which kept me in this great city. I teach Finnish because although I don't live in Finland anymore, I enjoy talking about it and having a chance to share our strange culture and language with other people. I have been teaching the beginners since early 2015, so I have seen my students getting more and more confident with their Finnish, which has to mean they learn something with me! If you ever see me either at the school or in other events, just come and say hi!
