About:

I teach the older children’s group. I have graduated as a secondary school teacher from University of Helsinki 2010 (MA) and I taught RE and history in Finland before moving to the UK. I am interested in student centered pedagogies and learning by doing (ilmiöpohjainen oppiminen). The ethos in recent Finnish pedagogics is that students learn by doing projects around a certain theme –the beauty of this approach is that students learn how to use the information they have in real life and the distinction between separate school subjects is minimized.

This is my first year in the Bristol Finnish School and I am looking forward to meet  all old and new students. Tervetuloa!
