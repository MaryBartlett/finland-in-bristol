Welcome to Finland in Bristol! We are a collective of Finnish and Finland-minded people in and around Bristol. We organise (link: /calendar text: social events) for everyone who has some sort of ties or just genuine interest for Finland and Finnish culture. We also have a (link: /school text: Saturday school) for anyone wishing to learn the language.

Whether you are a young adult, mature citizen or a family, you are always welcome to come along to our events.

And don't be shy, we are quite charming and social despite being Finnish!
